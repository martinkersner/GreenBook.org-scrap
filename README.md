Hi I'm new on web scraping and I need help to get all   

      <a href>

of each company from the list shown on this URL: 
http://www.greenbook.org/market-research-companies/united-states-of-america. 
Then I need to present it on a table. I need a code that will first get all 
the url of each company and then those url I need to get the company name, 
contact name, tel no, email address. Is there a script / a web scrapping tool
